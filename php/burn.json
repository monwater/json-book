To write a novel is an exercise in concentration. If we are going to deploy such effort over many months or years, the prerequisite is a sufficiently strong desire to complete the task  motivation-as-fuel. Pick up a good book and weigh it in your hand. You can smell the exhaust trail of the distinct types of fuel used in writing it. The reader is typically able to detect the root of the writers motivation, where it started, and how it kept going."

However, there are slow burns as well: a candle, and the hand-warmer I was given during a childhood ski-trip that smouldered in a drawstring velvet pouch in my pocket. Most works of fiction accelerate into the literary firmament using a variety of fuels. This means that if we think of a book as having a single engine, the analogy immediately risks not making sense. It is necessary to think instead of the novel as more akin to a hybrid car, something that contains at least two types of engine."

Such awareness gilds the photo, for the modern viewer, with an unpreventable sense of loss. With such awareness, with such knowledge, comes the horror that Joseph Conrad had glimpsed, as if by flashes of lightning, in <i>Heart of Darkness</i>; the horror of the kind that Orwell himself was himself to experience and to capture so well not by the flash of lightning, but by something more comparable to the unbearable torment of a looped film clip that is destined to repeat without end."

Orwell deliberately descended into poverty for two years in Paris in order to explore the conditions faced by an enslaved working class (<i>Down and Out in Paris and London</i> [1933]).

Their media become media proper only under their hands; through shaping they communicate. As artists they are uniquely sovereign, minting unminted bullion into currency, stamping their image upon it. The poet is denied this creative sovereignty. His material cause is a medium before he starts to fashion it; he must deal in an already current and largely defaced coinage. In fact, it is not even a coinage, but rather a paper currency. Words, as the poet finds them, are tokens for real things, which they are supposed to signify  drafts upon a hoard of reality which it would be too cumbersome to put into circulation. Not merely is the poet denied the privilege of coining his own medium; his medium lacks all corporeality, is a system of signs which have only a secondary, referential substance.

However, I believe that if a proportion of Hollinghursts motive was political  to show us the 1980s in all its brutal acquisitiveness  it is a flicker more than a flame. When it appeared, the novel was described as a satire on Thatcherism or a treatise on Thatcherism, and it offers social commentary  the wider political context is embraced (<i>Daily Star</i>, 28 January 2005)  but Hollinghurst sticks to his Jamesian strengths: acute observation allied to beautiful expression. He seeks the line of beauty. I do not have any argument with his political insight but I would argue that his political embrace is weak because that is not the fuel this writer is burning, it is not the area in which his talent is generous.

How cleverly he gives us a sketch of his physical appearance and his gait: the width of a small van across the shoulders, and he moved noiselessly, as though on castors (Barry, 2007: 2), before he draws away to allow us a breathing space and to see Broad Street as it revelled in the languor of evening heat (Barry, 2007: 3), returning to give us more brushwork on Jamess character. In this way he allows each layer of paint to dry before he adds the next, and each time a layer is added, it changes  deepens  our perception of the character. The seemingly rock-solid confidence of this youth, and the sympathy Barry has carefully elicited for him, with his kindness to the younger children, his grace and skill at the pool table and at the pinball machine, and most importantly his sense of humour, is subtly questioned by his crude over-confidence with the girls. Between each layer of colour, Kevin Barry takes us outside again, to refresh our view. And then comes a stand-out line from the local policeman, Garda Ryan, as the latter squares up to James cheek, I dont care whose family youre from (Barry, 2007: 11). With this line Kevin Barry allows us a final insight, the submerged part of Jamess character is not confident at all, but instead the opposite: James is trying to live up to his familys reputation. He is like the cartoon character having run off the edge of the cliff: running fast, but with nothing except thin air below. The picture is complete. This allows Barry, when he abruptly spins us forward ten years, to show us Jamess fate: on a low September evening [James] would swim out too far and drown (Barry, 2007: 12). In just half an hours reading, Barry produces a perfectly realized portrait. "
