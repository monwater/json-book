WANT TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS: download the entire PHP folder and open the chapter-parser.php file


This is a project to develop an organized data structure for JSON books, journals and magazines. The approach being taken is to develop the structure for the JSON alongside a set of parsers in order to establish an organic logic.

Aims to incorporate:

- automated note numbering
- reference linking (see reference-structure-outline.txt)
- built-in support for multi-lingual books
- indexing by hashtags - see http://sketchytech.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/hashtags-not-hyperlinks-index-of-future.html
  
Next things to add and amend:

- continue extending and implementing class/object structure to PHP
- add parsing function for hyperlinks
- add parsing function for notes

After the "next things":

- begin working on chapter level parsing
- handle blockquotes, titles, subtitles, images

Note: The initial parser is written in PHP for convenience but will be adapted to other languages and scripts (including JavaScript and Objective-C for iOS)

- iOS parser now in progress - see iOS folder
