bookjson
========

This is a project to develop an organized data structure for JSON books, journals and magazines. The approach being taken is to develop the structure for the JSON alongside a set of parsers in order to establish an organic logic.

Aims to incorporate:

automated note numbering
built-in support for multi-lingual books
indexing by hashtags - see http://sketchytech.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/hashtags-not-hyperlinks-index-of-future.html
