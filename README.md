json-book
========


This is a project to develop an organized data structure for JSON books, journals and magazines. The approach being taken is to develop the structure for the JSON alongside a set of parsers in order to establish an organic logic.

IT WILL BE FASTER, CLEANER, AND MORE ORGANIZED THAN ANY XML OR HTML STRUCTURE OR PARSER BUILT FOR THE SAME TASK. IT IS THE FUTURE OF BOOKS, A SHIFTING INTO THE FAST LANE, WHERE WE CAN SAVE TIME AND MONEY.

Programmers will find it easy to adapt the parsers for their own needs and to innovate, making stylish kick-ass designs using JavaScript, PHP, iOS, Android, Ruby, Python and any other programming or scripting language you can name.

The tech is being developed by a real-life editor and publisher who understands the needs, the constraints, and the current issues with other technologies. And sees that they are insufficient for future needs, and wants to get back to simply producing books in a format that will be permanent for the foreseable future.

WANT TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS: Most up to date version contained in: **php/indexing_in_progress/** folder. The **chapter-parsing.php** file displays chapter, the **index-parsing.php** file is for display of paragraphs that contain text from indexed term (Download entire folder to see functionality). For less rough and ready code - with less placeholders and hard coded tests - see the **chapter-parsing.php** file in **php** folder 

Updates and revisions are happening frequently, and a more structured and organised presentation will be available once a complete implementation is ready containing an entire book. The format and parsers will then be extended from books to journals (enabling inclusion of abstract, keywords, etc.). 

Even if you don't want to implement the structures and parsers as they are, the methodology and simplicity behind them will hopefully inspire.

Aims to incorporate:

- automated note numbering
- reference linking (see reference-structure-outline.txt)
- built-in support for multi-lingual books
- indexing by hashtags - see http://sketchytech.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/hashtags-not-hyperlinks-index-of-future.html
  
Next things to add and amend:

- continue extending and implementing class/object structure to PHP
- add parsing function for hyperlinks
- add parsing function for notes

After the "next things":

- begin working on chapter level parsing
- handle blockquotes, titles, subtitles, images

Note: The initial parser is written in PHP for convenience but will be adapted to other languages and scripts (including JavaScript and Objective-C for iOS)

- iOS parser now in progress - see iOS folder
