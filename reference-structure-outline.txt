JSON

Citation formatting (multiple authors represent by an array AND page numbers are optional string):

["author", "date", "page numbers"]


Reference formatting:

A useful reference structure for a chapter in an edited book that could be linked to citations:

["author", "date", "reference text", "link", "DOI"]

It could be made more complex if access to a high level of in-place meta-data was necessary:
[["author1", "author2"],"chapter title", "chapter subtitle", {"book":["editor1","editor2"],"title","subtitle","city","publisher","ISBN"}, "page numbers", "linking URL", "DOI"]

But it could be as simple as a string, although linking would then be more work:

"Author (date) 'chapter title', in editor (ed.) book title, page numbers. City: Publisher."

All three of these options should work in the final parser, since the JSON approach is all about flexibity.
